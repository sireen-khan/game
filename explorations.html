<p>]In this process, we used uno cards, die, many beads of different colors to represent different things, and several characters from several different games to create the game. The uno cards acted as special cards; if you landed on the  orange spaces, you would be able to pick up the special card. These speial cards determined how much money(green beads) you would get. The die acts as a main way to determine how many spaces you move. If you reach a certain point in the game, you would have to pay "tax". If you payed tax, you would get to open the mystery box. There were also some special spots on the board that were 'danger zones'. If the people that wen after you recieved a certain number, you would have to go back to the start, but if nobody gets that certain number before you and you end up getting it, you would get to make anyone you want to go back to the start. The goal of the game is to reach the end with the most money. Whoever has the most money at the end of the game wins. </p>

<p>It was pretty sinmple to create the characters that would be used for the game. The only thing that was hard was sometimes when I mispelled something or didn't write the correct characters or accdently added an extra space, it was hard to figure  out what my mistake actually was. Other than that, the process was pretty simple and straight forward. </p>
